  <h3>What is this tool?</h3><br>
  <p>
   NGL+, also known as Nefariously Generated Links, presents itself as an extension of the NGL.LINK app, a platform where users can create links to receive anonymous messages from their Instagram followers. However, this seemingly innocent facade conceals a phishing tool designed to exploit its's user's victims trust. NGL+ operates under the guise of the NGL.LINK app, leveraging the familiar interface to lure it's user's followers into a false sense of security. What sets NGL+ apart is its nefarious use of phishing techniques. Unlike the authentic NGL.LINK, NGL+ has the capability to deceive it's user's followers into submitting their Instagram login information. This deceptive method allows the apps users to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. 😈🔗
